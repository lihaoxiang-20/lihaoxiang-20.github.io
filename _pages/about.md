## ðŸ’¯About Me
I am a senoir student in Tsinghua University. My academic journey has been rigorously rooted in the fields of medical imaging and artificial intelligence, with specific coursework in Medical Image Processing, Medical Imaging Physics, Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, and an introduction to AI. My current research under the guidance of Assistant Professor Qiyuan Tian focuses on the reconstruction and segmentation of high-resolution fetal brain MRI images.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸ”¬Research Experiences

1. The candidate played a key role in the Urban Science SRT project by constructing a city traffic monitoring system, focusing on network establishment, data scraping and storage. They matched road network structures, utilized Python multithreading for data scraping, stored data in MySQL, and applied reinforcement learning for route optimization. They also co-authored a paper accepted by CIKM 2023.

2. In a medical engineering project, the candidate developed a simulation model for liver tumor thermal ablation, annotated tumor data, and trained a Unet model for automated preoperative segmentation of liver tumors.

3. As a visiting scholar, the candidate researched NLP models to enhance hypothesis generation, fine-tuned the LLaMA model for improved scientific reasoning, and is preparing to submit their findings to the Nips Workshop.

4. The candidate conducted fetal MRI image processing research, creating a processing pipeline for fetal brain analysis, adapting Freesurfer for fetal images, and contributing to a paper accepted by RSNA. The project was highly rated in Tsinghua University's Academic Promotion Program 2023.
