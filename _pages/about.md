## üë®‚ÄçüéìAbout Me
I am a senoir student in Tsinghua University. My academic journey has been rigorously rooted in the fields of medical imaging and artificial intelligence, with specific interest in Medical Image Processing, Medical Imaging Physics, Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learnin. My currenresearch under the guidance of Assistant Professor Qiyuan Tian focuses on the reconstruction and segmentation of high-resolution fetal brain MRI images.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! 

## üî¨Research Experiences

### Urban Science SRT project (Advisor: [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/))
We established a system for constructing, crawling, and storing urban traffic conditions, and utilized reinforcement learning to plan travel routes. The [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583780.3614732) has been accepted by CIKM2023. (2021-2022)

### Liver tumor thermal ablation project (Advisor: [Prof. Kui Ying](https://www.ep.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1166/2333.htm))
 under the guidance of professor Ying Kui, which proposed a liver tumor segmnetation model. (2022-2023)

3. AI4Science project under the guidance of professor Zhou Bowen, which focus on enhance large language model's scientific reasoning ability. The [paper](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/Instruction) has been accepted by NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following (2023)

4. MRI morphology analysis project under the guidance of professor Tian QiYuan, which focus on slice-to-volume reconstruction, AI tissue segmentation, and statistical analysis. The paper has been accepted by RSNA2023. (2023)
